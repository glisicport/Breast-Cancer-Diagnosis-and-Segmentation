# Breast Cancer Diagnosis System

## Description

This project is designed to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer by leveraging deep learning technologies. It features a web application that allows users to upload mammogram images. These images are processed through a two-model system consisting of:

1. **Segmentation Model**: Identifies and crops the regions of interest in the mammogram images where potential cancerous lesions are located.
2. **Classification Model**: Analyzes the cropped regions to determine whether the lesions are benign or malignant.

The results are then returned to the web app for user review, aiding medical professionals in making more accurate diagnoses.
